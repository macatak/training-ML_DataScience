# Udemy Bootcamp for a Python Data Science Machine Learning bootcamp

## Notebooks beginning with 'Section-' follow the Udemy sections. These are the complete sections in the bootcamp i.e. they cover a lot of different subjects.  
- These are further along in the training.  
- The code does not strictly follow the training but also contain things I did outside the training to clarify some things. Everything in the training is there but there are some additions. 
- For whatever reason these do not strictly follow the numbered sections in the training but they do follow the way the sections are presented. Not sure why the presenter did that. 

## Notebooks beginning with a number are the individual chapters. They contain more subject specific and mostly base Python related

## The notes documents follow the section notes. They are rough drafts.
